Bam! Bob, the big bat, bit Ben's bag... Bad bug! But Bob's bib?? Bitten?! Boo! Bet Ben's box bled blue—boldly! Bob's boo-boo: bad, bad, BAD! "Bun, bun, bun!" barked Ben. Bob blinked... Buzz! Boom!! "Bam, Bob! Bop it back!" said Ben.
Boxy Bob baked big buns. Butter... bacon? Bold bite!! Ben bit back: bam, bam, BAM!! Bob bowed, beaten—Ben burst! Belly, bop, boo! Bit by bit, Bob built Ben’s box. Ban? Nah, bop!
"Bob, beg Ben!" "Bet I’ll bend back," Bob blabbed. Boo! Both big bugs bit Ben. "Brrr," bawled Bob, beneath Ben’s bib. Bob's bad? Bet big bucks, baby! Bam!! Boom!!! BOO!!!
